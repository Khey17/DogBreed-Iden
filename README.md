####Using Transfer Learning and Tensorflow 2.9 to Classify different Dog Breeds

In this project we're going to be using machine learning to help us identify different breeds of dogs.

To do this, we'll be using data from the https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dog-breed-identification/leaderboard. It consists of a collection of 10000+ labelled images of 120 different dog breeds.

This kind of problem is called multi-class image classification. It's multi-class because we're trying to classify multiple different breeds of dog. If we were only trying to classify dogs versus cats, it would be called binary classification.

Mutli-class image classification is an important problem because it's the same kind of technology Tesla uses in classifying real world objects for self-driving cars.
